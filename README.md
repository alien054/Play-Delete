# Play-Delete
Play and immediately delete watched video

I like to watch tv series a lot and also I hate to rewatch any show. So everytime I watch a show I immediately delete the episod. 
This was a boring task to do by hand so I automate it.


Just copy the play.py file into the directory where the files are located and run

```
python play.py
```

There will be a prompt which will ask you if you want to play the next episod. If you click yes the previous file will be deleted automatically. 

Also there is option where you can copy the files so the you can play next episod without deleting.
